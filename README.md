## 🏛️ Project Philosophy

KPaperFlux is a **Document Refiner** designed for precision and technical sovereignty. While traditional systems focus on archival and search, KPaperFlux aims at **deep understanding**: converting visual and textual information into structured, mathematically validated data.

*   **Forensic Separation:** Specialized engines extract "noise" (stamps, signatures, handwriting) for separate analysis, ensuring the integrity of the core transactional data.
*   **Multi-Type-Tag Architecture:** Documents are managed using a polymorphic tagging system. For documents identified with a `Finance` tag, KPaperFlux enforces strict EN 16931 (ZUGFeRD) data management for high-fidelity accounting and analytics.
*   **Data Control & AI Choice:** Physical document storage and vault management are strictly local. Users can opt for high-performance semantic analysis via Google Gemini, accepting the trade-offs of cloud-based processing, or rely on local-only extraction for maximum privacy (foregoing advanced AI insights).
*   **Automated Validation:** Integrated logic engines perform cross-checks on financial totals and tax rates, prioritizing consistency and factual accuracy.

## 🔥 Technical Highlights

### 🧠 Semantic Analysis Pipeline
*   **Multi-Stage Extraction:** Uses an adaptive pipeline (Stage 1 to 2) to classify documents and extract structured JSON compliant with **EN 16931 (ZUGFeRD 2.2)**.
*   **Visual Auditor (X-Ray):** Separates visual artifacts (accounting stamps, handwritten "Paid" notes, signatures) from the background text for independent analysis.
*   **Mathematical Integrity:** Automated cross-checking of net/tax/gross totals to ensure 100% calculation consistency.

### 📄 Professional PDF Rendering
*   **Re-Materialization:** Generates high-quality, DIN 5008 compliant PDF documents from semantic data.
*   **Advanced Layouting:** Dynamic column calculation for item lists, automatic pagination, and specialized support for certificates (RoHS, REACH) and legal statements.

### 🧩 Hybrid PDF & Forensic Trust
*   **Vector Protection:** Instead of "baking" scans into PDFs, KPaperFlux overlays transparent signatures on original vector documents, preserving 1:1 text quality and minimal file size.
*   **Chain of Trust:** Hybrid PDFs automatically embed the original digitally signed source document as an attachment for legal validity.

### 🤖 Agent-Based Workflows
*   **Playbooks:** Process documents through custom-defined state machines (e.g., `VERIFIED` → `TO_PAY` → `ARCHIVED`).
*   **Automation:** Intelligent routing based on AI-evaluated metadata.

### 📊 Advanced Reporting & Dynamic Dashboards
*   **Dynamic Analytics:** Real-time generation of charts (Bar, Pie, Line) based on your entire document corpus.
*   **Intelligent Visualization:** Pie charts with automatic "Others" grouping, side legends with elision, and pattern-based color distinction for maximum readability.
*   **Relative Date Filtering:** Predefined smart filters (Today, YTD, Last 90 Days) that stay dynamic as time passes.
*   **Global Zooming:** Visual consistency from 50% to 300% zoom across all report elements.

### 📦 Multi-Format Data Export
*   **Structured Data:** Export report results to CSV for external spreadsheet analysis.
*   **Document Archives:** One-click ZIP export of all original PDF source documents associated with a specific report.
*   **Hybrid PDF Reports:** (In Progress) Exporting visual reports as PDFs with embedded semantic metadata.

---

## 🏗️ Status & Development
*   **Current State:** Active development. High-stability core with rapidly evolving reporting and export capabilities.
*   **Reporting:** Feature-complete dynamic dashboard engine with multi-format export.
*   **GUI:** Solid desktop experience; optimized for high-density information displays.
*   **Standardization:** Strict adherence to European invoicing standards (EN 16931).
